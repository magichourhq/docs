## Adjust FPS of Output in Video-to-Video

In Video-to-Video mode, you can now adjust the FPS of your final video. The two options are full FPS (same FPS as original video) and half FPS (half the FPS of the original video). The default is half FPS, as there's usually not a significant difference between half and full FPS, but full FPS may be good for professional use cases or videos that you want to appear more "full." Note that full FPS costs twice the frames of half FPS.
