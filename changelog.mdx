<Update label="2025-07-30">

## Added background replacement functionality to Image Background Remover API

We've added background replacement functionality to the Image Background Remover API. You can now replace the background of an image with a new background.

To take advantage of the this change, please upgrade your sdk version to `v0.33.0`.

- [Python SDK v0.33.0](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-python/releases/tag/v0.33.0)
- [Node SDK v0.33.0](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-node/releases/tag/v0.33.0)
- [Go SDK v0.33.0](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-go/releases/tag/v0.33.0)

<Update label="2025-07-29">

## Added support for individual face swapping in Face Swap Video API

We've enhanced the Face Swap Video API to support selective face swapping. You can now specify which faces to swap in a video using the new `face_mappings` parameter. This gives you more precise control over face swapping operations.

To take advantage of the this change, please upgrade your sdk version to `v0.32.0`.

- [Python SDK v0.32.0](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-python/releases/tag/v0.32.0)
- [Node SDK v0.32.0](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-node/releases/tag/v0.32.0)
- [Go SDK v0.32.0](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-go/releases/tag/v0.32.0)
- [Rust SDK v0.32.0](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-rust/releases/tag/v0.31.1)

Note: `v0.31.0` had a bug where the `image_file_path` is still required even if you're using `face_swap_mode: individual-faces`. This has been fixed in `v0.31.1`.

## Fixed authentication issue on `GET /v1/face-detection/{id}` API

We noticed that the `GET /v1/face-detection/{id}` API was always returning 401 Unauthorized. We have since fixed the issue and the API should now be working as expected.

To take advantage of the this change, please upgrade your sdk version to `v0.30.1`.

- [Python SDK v0.30.1](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-python/releases/tag/v0.30.1)
- [Node SDK v0.30.1](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-node/releases/tag/v0.30.1)
- [Go SDK v0.30.1](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-go/releases/tag/v0.30.1)
- [Rust SDK v0.30.1](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-rust/releases/tag/v0.30.1)

</Update>

<Update label="2025-07-28">

## Added APIs for face detection and face swap

We added two new APIs for face detection and face swap:

[`POST /v1/face-detection`](/api-reference/files/face-detection)

- Detect faces in an image or video

[`GET /v1/face-detection/{id}`](/api-reference/files/get-face-detection-details)

- Get the result of a face detection job
- Detected faces are added to the response as `faces` as soon as any face is detected.

Example usage:

```python
res = client.v1.face_detection.create(
    assets={
        "target_file_path": "https://cdn.magichour.ai/target.jpg",
    },
    confidence_score='0.75',
)

task_id = res.id
status = "pending"

while status != 'complete':
  res = client.v1.face_detection.get(id=task_id)
  status = res.status
  time.sleep(1)

res = client.v1.face_swap_photo.create(
    assets={
        "face_swap_mode": 'individual-faces',
        "target_file_path": "https://cdn.magichour.ai/target.jpg",
        "face_mappings": [
            {
                "new_face": "https://cdn.magichour.ai/new_face.jpg",
                "original_face": res.faces[0].path
            }
        ]
    },
)
```

To take advantage of the this change, please upgrade your sdk version to `v0.30.0`.

## Fixing duration issue in 480p Image to Video and Text to Video

</Update>

<Update label="2025-07-14">

## Fixing webhook timeout issue

We were notified that webhook delivery was seeing delays. This was caused by a invalid webhook configuration where the delivery was not properly timing out in a reasonable amount of time. We have since fixed the issue and webhook delivery should be back to normal.

<Update label="2025-07-13">

## Cheaper Image to Video and Text to Video

We introduced a new 480p resolution for Image to Video and Text to Video, which is 60% cheaper!

For a 5s video, 480p uses 120 credits, while 720p uses 300 credits.

Note that the 480p resolution only support 5s or 10s videos.

## Simplify file upload

We updated the signature of the upload url from the `POST /v1/files/upload-urls` endpoint to not require `Content-Type` header. This should simplify the upload process a bit, you're welcome to pass in the content type of your file or leave it completely.

```diff
 with open(local_path, 'rb') as file:
     response = requests.put(
         response.items[0].upload_url,
         data=file,

## Add generation mode and intensity param to talking photo API

## 🚀 Brand new Pricing Page

We've redesigned our pricing page to make it easier to pick the right plan for you. The new page includes a clear breakdown of how many videos and images you can generate with each plan.

No more guesswork — just clear, upfront info so you can create with confidence.

## Renamed `frames` to `credit` in the API.

We originally named our credit system `frame` because we started off only having video modes, but since we now include images as well, using frame as the name of our credit system can cause confusion, so we renamed it.

We introduced this change in sdk v0.22.0, and deprecated fields referencing `frames`

- added `credits_charged` field in the API response for get details API and success responses from create API calls.
- deprecated `total_frame_cost` from the `GET /v1/video-projects/:id` API.
- deprecated `estimated_frame_cost` from the success response in create video API.
- deprecated `total_frame_cost` from the `GET /v1/image-projects/:id` API.
- deprecated `frame_cost` from the success response in create image API.

To take advantage of the this change, please upgrade your sdk version to `0.22.0`.

<Update label="2025-04-20">

## Simplify Lip Sync API and New AI Face Editor API

We removed `height` and `width` as required params for the `POST /v1/lip-sync` API. We now will automatically figure out aspect ratio of the input video and resize based on your subscription's maximum resolution. This makes it easier to create the video as you no longer need to figure out the aspect ratio of your input video and compute the height/width.

We also released `POST /v1/ai-face-editor` API.

To take advantage of the this change, please upgrade your sdk version to `0.16.0`.

## Stable Mode in Face Swap Video and Photo

We launched **Stable Mode** in Face Swap Video and Photo, which reduces flickering in face swaps with beards, mustaches, piercings, and other items on the face. To use it, select "Stable Mode" under the setting Face Mask after uploading a video. The default setting, "Smart Mode," remains the same and is recommended for most videos.

### 🎉 Create Memes via API

We added `POST /v1/ai-meme-generator` to our APIs and SDKs. Now you can create memes even faster!

Check out [API reference](/api-reference/image-projects/ai-meme-generator)

### ⚠️ Breaking changes in GET image/video project APIs

The `GET /v1/video-projects/:id` and `GET /v1/image-projects/:id` API type field is updated from enum to string field. This field is mainly used for internal filtering, and having the field being enum means any new mode we add becomes a breaking change. So we decided to introduce this breaking change once so we can more easily add new modes down the line.

## Added `high_quality` Param to Image-to-Video API

We previously introduced a `High Quality` checkbox to the web app. Now, our API supports high quality generation as well. As a quick recap, "High Quality" is better at detail preservation, ideal for humans and complex images.

<VideoPlayer src="https://videos.magichour.ai/api-assets/docs/image-to-video-high-quality.mp4" />

To use high quality mode, simply add `.style.high_quality` param when calling the API.

```diff
{
    "style": {
+        "high_quality": true
    }
}
```

## File URL Support for 5 different APIs.

To make it easier to work with input files, we added support for file urls for the following APIs:

- POST /v1/ai-headshot-generator
- POST /v1/ai-image-upscaler
- POST /v1/image-background-remover
- POST /v1/image-to-video
- POST /v1/lip-sync

Now you don't have to upload the file to Magic Hour storage first before using the asset in the APIs. Simply use the url in the `file_path` inputs:

```json
{
  "audio_file_path": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/audio.mp3",
  "image_file_path": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/image.png",
  "video_file_path": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/video.mp4"
