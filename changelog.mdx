<Update label="2025-02-16">

## Animation and Video-to-Video APIs Now Allow File URLs.

To make it easier to use input files, we have now updated final two endpoints to support file urls for input files:

- `POST /v1/animation`
- `POST /v1/video-to-video`

Now, you won't have to upload files to our storage first before calling these two APIs.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="POST /v1/video-to-video">

<CodeGroup>

```python Python SDK {4}
res = client.v1.video_to_video.create(
    assets={
        "video_source": "file",
        "video_file_path": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/video.mp4"
    }
)
```

```typescript Node SDK {4}
const res = await client.v1.videoToVideo.create({
  assets: {
    videoSource: "file",
    videoFilePath: "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/video.mp4",

    Assets: types.PostV1VideoToVideoBodyAssets{
        VideoSource:   types.PostV1VideoToVideoBodyAssetsVideoSourceEnumFile,
        VideoFilePath: nullable.NewValue("https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/video.mp4"),
    },
})
```

```rust Rust SDK {4}

## Generate Subtitle for 3+ Minutes Videos

We added the `Auto Subtitle Generator` to our dashboard! The max duration of our [current tool](https://magichour.ai/products/auto-subtitle-generator) is 30 seconds. We have now expanded the max to 10,000 frames. This means you can generate videos of length:

- 6.9 minutes at 24fps
- 5.5 minutes at 30fps

<Update label="2025-02-12">

## Added `high_quality` Param to Image-to-Video API

We previously introduced a `High Quality` checkbox to the web app. Now, our API supports high quality generation as well. As a quick recap, "High Quality" is better at detail preservation, ideal for humans and complex images.

<Frame>
  <video
    loop
    controls
    autoPlay
    muted
    playsInline
    className="w-full aspect-video"
    src="https://videos.magichour.ai/api-assets/docs/image-to-video-high-quality.webm"
  ></video>
</Frame>

To use high quality mode, simply add `.style.high_quality` param when calling the API.

```diff
{
    "style": {
+        "high_quality": true
    }
}
```

## File URL Support for 5 different APIs.

To make it easier to work with input files, we added support for file urls for the following APIs:

- POST /v1/ai-headshot-generator
- POST /v1/ai-image-upscaler
- POST /v1/image-background-remover
- POST /v1/image-to-video
- POST /v1/lip-sync

Now you don't have to upload the file to Magic Hour storage first before using the asset in the APIs. Simply use the url in the `file_path` inputs:

```json
{
  "audio_file_path": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/audio.mp3",
  "image_file_path": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/image.png",
  "video_file_path": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/video.mp4"
}
```

<Update label="2025-02-05">

## Added More Error Codes For More Visibility

We added 4 more API error codes to help you identify why a particular render failed. You can get the error details using the `GET /v1/image-projects/:id` and `GET /v1/video-projects/:id` endpoints by accessing `.error.code` and `.error.message` fields.

| Error Code            | Error Message                                                                                                                       |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invalid_audio_file`  | The audio file contains invalid data. Please try a different file.                                                                  |
| `invalid_image_file`  | The image file contains invalid data. Please try a different file.                                                                  |
| `invalid_video_file`  | The video file contains invalid data. Please try a different file.                                                                  |
| `invalid_youtube_url` | The youtube video cannot be downloaded. The video may be private, age-restricted, or region-restricted. Please try a different url. |

<Update label="2024-12-29">

## File URL Support for Face Swap Video and Photo APIs.

To make it easier to use input files, we now allow file URLs for `image_file_path` and `video_file_path` in the following APIs:

- POST /v1/face-swap
- POST /v1/face-swap-photo

Simply pass the url in the `file_path` inputs:

```json
{
  "image_file_path": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/image.png",
  "video_file_path": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/files/video.mp4"
}
```

</Update>

<Update label="2024-12-27">

## Increased Video Download URL Expiration

In the response of `GET /v1/video-projects/:id`, the expiration time is increased from **1 hour** to **24 hours**.

The `GET /v1/image-projects/:id` was already returning 24 hours expiration, so this change make both of these APIs have matching behavior.

</Update>

<Update label="2024-12-17">

## Added `.downloads` key to `GET /v1/video-projects/:id`

In the response of `GET /v1/video-projects/:id`, we added `.downloads` key to return a list of output urls. This make video and image project response have matching behavior so it's easier to work with both APIs.

<Note>The `.download` key is still part of the response to ensure backwards compatibility.</Note>

```diff
{
- "download": {
-     "url": "https://video.magichour.ai/id/output.mp4?auth-token=1234",
-     "expires_at": "2024-12-18T00:00:00.000Z"
- },

<Update label="2024-12-06">

## Specify Height & Width Must be at Least 64px in `POST /v1/video-to-video`

This is an API validation update to ensure that `height` and `width` of the API call are both above 64.

Originally, this was not validated at the API level, and the video will fail to render. Now, you will get a validation error for invalid height/width in the request body.

For example, passing `height: 32` will return in the following 400 response:

```json
{
  "message": "Request validation failed",
  "pathParameterErrors": null,
  "headerErrors": null,
  "queryParameterErrors": null,
  "bodyErrors": {
    "issues": [
      {
        "code": "too_small",
        "minimum": 64,
        "type": "number",
        "inclusive": true,
        "exact": false,
        "message": "Number must be greater than or equal to 64",
        "path": ["height"]
      }
    ],
    "name": "ZodError"
  }
}
```

</Update>

<Update label="2024-12-04">

## Add Animation to API

Now you can create stop-motion animations via API. Get started with this new API using:

- [Python SDK](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-python/tree/main/magic_hour/resources/v1/animation)
- [Node SDK](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-node/tree/main/src/resources/v1/animation)
- [Go SDK](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-go/tree/main/resources/v1/animation)
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-rust/tree/main/src/resources/v1/animation)
- [Rest API](/api-reference/image-projects/animation)

<Note>Fun Fact: Animation was the first mode we built on Magic Hour!</Note>

</Update>

<Update label="2024-12-03">

## Error Visibility on Errors

Previously, whenever an error occurred on generation, there's no additional details on why.

We now added an `error` key to the `GET /v1/image-projects/:id` and `GET /v1/video-projects/:id` APIs to give you deeper visibility into what happened.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "<error code>",
    "message": "<explanation of error>"
  }
}
```

If you see `unknown_error` as the code, please reach out to our team at support@magichour.ai to debug further.

## Delete Image/Video Project APIs

After you downloaded the output, you now can delete the generated asset from our storage. This is a highly requested feature from our API users to improve privacy for the end user.

Now you can call

```
DELETE /v1/image-projects/:id
DELETE /v1/video-projects/:id
```

This change is also released to all SDKs.

- [Python SDK](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-python/tree/main/magic_hour/resources/v1/video_projects)
- [Node SDK](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-node/tree/main/src/resources/v1/video-projects)
- [Go SDK](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-go/tree/main/resources/v1/video_projects)
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/magichourhq/magic-hour-rust/tree/main/src/resources/v1/video_projects)

</Update>

<Update label="2024-11-29">

## Improve Error Message When File Path is Invalid

If the `audio_file_path`, `image_file_path`, or `video_file_path` points to a file that does not exist in our storage, we previously returns the error

> Asset path api-assets/id/video.mp4 is invalid

This error is not very actionable. The new error is now:

> file path ' api-assets/id/video.mp4' does not exist. Please make sure that the value matches the 'items.[].file_path' from the /v1/files/upload-urls API and the files are uploaded by sending a PUT request to the upload url.

</Update>

<Update label="2024-11-25">

## Added `max_fps_limit` to `POST /v1/lip-sync`

This was a feature requested by one of our API users, who wanted reduce frame usage while using APIs. Allowing to set a `max_fps_limit` means you limit the maximum of cost of the video.

For example, if the original video has an FPS of 60 with a duration of 10 seconds, generation would previously cost **600** frames. Now, you can pass `"max_fps_limit": 24` and only be charged **240** frames.

If the video fps is lower than the `max_fps_limit` set, we will deduct frames based on the actual
FPS of the video

You can see more details in the [API Reference](/api-reference/video-projects/lip-sync#body-max-fps-limit)

</Update>

<Update label="2024-11-23">

## Longer Videos for Face Swap and Lip Sync

We updated the maximum frames for Face Swap Video and Lip Sync from 6,000 to 20,000 frames.

Now you can generate videos that are **3.3x** longer! 📈

The table summaries the length of video you can generate for a few common video FPS:

| FPS | Previous                                        | New                                              |
| :-- | :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| 24  | {Math.floor(6000 / 24 / 60 / 0.1) / 10} minutes | {Math.floor(20000 / 24 / 60 / 0.1) / 10} minutes |
| 30  | {Math.floor(6000 / 30 / 60 / 0.1) / 10} minutes | {Math.floor(20000 / 30 / 60 / 0.1) / 10} minutes |
| 60  | {Math.floor(6000 / 60 / 60 / 0.1) / 10} minutes | {Math.floor(20000 / 60 / 60 / 0.1) / 10} minutes |

You can create your webhook by going to the [Developer Hub](https://magichour.ai/developer)

</Update>

<Update label="2024-11-15">
## Make `name` Actually Optional in APIs

Currently, the `name` field in APIs are `nullable`, when it should be `optional`. Before this change, even if you didn't want to add a name for a particular render, you still need to pass in the key with a `null` value.

```json
{
  "name": null
}
```

After this change, you can leave off `name` completely.

</Update>

<Update label="2024-11-13">
