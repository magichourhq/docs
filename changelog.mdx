  ![Free Add Sound to Video (5s

We launched a free tool that generates audio for your uploaded video and merges it back into the clip. Upload a video and generation starts immediately so you can hear results fast.

You get 3 free generations per day, and each preview covers the first 5 seconds of your video. Output is the same video file with the newly generated audio track—no separate audio download required. The primary action is labeled “Add Sound to Video (5s)”.

Nano Banana 2 is now available in both the AI Image Editor and AI Image Generator. In the model selector, it appears with the description: “Fast, high-quality with strong prompt adherence and reliable text.”

Due to higher compute costs, Nano Banana 2 consumes 2x the credits of Nano Banana when selected.
