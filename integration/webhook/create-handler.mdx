## Create a handler

Setup an HTTPS endpoint function that:

- Handles POST request with a JSON payload
- Returns a successful status code (2xx)

### Retries

If event delivery failed, meaning the response from your endpoint did not respond with a status code of 2XX, we will retry delivery up to **24 hours** with exponential backoff.

After 24 hours, the event will be marked as failed and will not be retried.

In the case where the webhook is disabled, pending events for the webhook will be skipped. These events will also be marked as failed after 24 hours.

### Sample handler

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhook")
async def webhook(request: Request):
    event = await request.json()
    match event.type:
        case 'video.started':
            print('Video processing started')
        case 'video.completed':
            print('Video processing completed')
        case 'video.errored':
            print('Video processing errored')
    return {"success": True}
```

```typescript Node
const express = require("express");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/webhook", (req, res) => {
  const { type, payload } = req.body;

  switch (type) {
    case "video.started":
      console.log("Video processing started:");
      break;
    case "video.completed":
      console.log("Video processing completed");
      break;
    case "video.errored":
      console.log("Video processing errored");
      break;
  }

  res.status(200).json({ success: true });
});
const port = 8000;
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server started on ${port}`));
```

</CodeGroup>

## Testing your handler

Start your web server

<CodeGroup>

```sh Python
fastapi dev
```

```sh Node
node server.js
```

</CodeGroup>

Then send a sample event via curl

```sh
curl http://localhost:8000/webhook \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "type": "video.completed",
  "payload": {
    "id": "clx7uu86w0a5qp55yxz315r6r",
    "name": "Example Name",
    "status": "complete",
    "type": "ANIMATION",
    "created_at": "2024-10-19T05:10:19.027Z",
    "width": 512,
    "height": 960,
    "enabled": true,
    "start_seconds": 0,
    "end_seconds": 15,
    "total_frame_cost": 450,
    "credits_charged": 450,
    "fps": 30,
    "error": null,
    "downloads": [
      {
        "url": "https://videos.magichour.ai/id/output.mp4",
        "expires_at": "2024-10-19T05:16:19.027Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}'
```

and verify the result in your application logic.
