Magic Hour's API allows you to upload various types of assets needed for video generation. This guide explains how to manage these assets effectively.

## Supported asset types

The follow file extensions are supported by our APIs:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Video" icon="film">
    mp4, m4v, mov, webm
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audio" icon="music">
    mp3, mpeg, wav, aac, aiff, flac
  </Card>
  <Card title="Image" icon="image">
    png, jpg, jpeg, webp, avif, jp2, tiff, bmp
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>`gif` extension is only supported by face swap API's `video_file_path` field.</Note>

## Available options for assets

You have two options when it come to using input files:

- Pass a URL as the input (simplest)
- Upload to our storage (do not require hosting files yourself)

## Passing a file URL

This is the simplest method if you have the files hosted somewhere. When calling our APIs, you can simply pass the URL as the `video_file_path`, `image_file_path`, or `audio_file_path`.

For Example

```json
{
  "assets": {
    "video_file_file": "https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/video.mp4"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  The URL can be an authenticated url, as long as we can validate the file extension is supported.
</Tip>

## Upload to Magic Hour storage

To upload assets for video generation, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Request upload URLs for your assets, you need to specificy the file extension and the type of the file.
2. Upload the files to the provided URLs by sending a PUT request.
3. Use the `file_path` value from the original upload url response in your API calls.

The following code samples provide a full example of how to upload a video file to Magic Hour storage.

```python Python SDK
from magic_hour import Client
import requests

client = Client(token="YOUR_API_KEY") # change to your API key

response = client.v1.files.upload_urls.create(
    items=[
        {"extension": "mp4", "type": "video"},
        # if you have multiple files to upload, you can request multiple upload urls
        # the order of the response will be in the same order as the request
        # {"extension": "mp3", "type": "audio"},
        # {"extension": "png", "type": "image"},
    ]
)

local_path = "/path/to/file/video.mp4" # change to your local file path
with open(local_path, 'rb') as file:
    response = requests.put(
        response.items[0].upload_url,
        data=file,
    )

file_path = response.items[0].file_path

# now you can use `file_path` in your API calls for
# `video_file_path`, `image_file_path`, or `audio_file_path
```

```typescript Node SDK
import { writeFileSync } from "fs";
import Client from "magic-hour";

const client = new Client({ token: "YOUR_API_KEY" }); // change to your API key

const response = await client.v1.files.uploadUrls.create({
  items: [
    { extension: "mp4", type: "video" },
    // if you have multiple files to upload, you can request multiple upload urls
    // the order of the response will be in the same order as the request
    // { extension: "mp3", type: "audio" },
    // { extension: "png", type: "image" },
  ],
});

const local_path = "/path/to/file/video.mp4"; // change to your local file path
const file = fs.readFileSync(local_path);

await fetch(response.items[0].upload_url, {
  method: "PUT",
  body: file,
});

const file_path = response.items[0].file_path;

// now you can use `file_path` in your API calls for
// `video_file_path`, `image_file_path`, or `audio_file_path`

# `video_file_path`, `image_file_path`, or `audio_file_path`
```

## Uploaded file lifecycle

Uploaded files are automatically cleaned up after **7 days**.

<Tip>
  You can reference the value in `.items.[].file_path` in multiple API calls before the file is
  cleaned up.
</Tip>

If you have use cases where having more permanent storage is required, please reach out to our team at support@magichour.ai.
