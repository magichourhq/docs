## Getting Started

### **Step 1: Estimate Your Usage**

- Review your expected monthly API calls
- Consider seasonal variations in usage
- Factor in growth projections

### **Step 2: Compare Costs**

- **Low usage (< 10,000 credits/month)**: Consider Free tier or Creator subscription
- **Medium usage (10,000-50,000 credits/month)**: Compare Creator/Pro subscription vs usage-based
- **High usage (> 50,000 credits/month)**: Usage-based often provides better value with volume discounts

### **Step 3: Choose Your Model**

- **Steady usage**: Subscription for predictable costs
- **Variable usage**: Usage-based for flexibility
- **Uncertain usage**: Start with usage-based, switch to subscription later
