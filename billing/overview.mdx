## Subscription options

When you're ready to ramp up your API usage, you have two subscription options to choose from:

- Usage based subscription
- Prepaid subscription

There are pros and cons of each option depending on your own use cases.

### Usage-based pricing

Our usage-based plans allow you to pay only for what you use, with billing occurring after usage. This model is great for users with variable needs or those who prefer a pay-as-you-go approach.

Usage-based pricing includes volume discounts, so each credit becomes cheaper as you scale.

### Prepaid subscriptions

With our prepaid subscriptions, you pay upfront for a set amount of credits that you can use throughout the duration of the subscription. This option is ideal for users with predictable usage patterns who want to lock in their costs.

You have the option to pay monthly or yearly. Yearly subscriptions offers a 2 month discount.
