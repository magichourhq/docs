description: Pay only for what you use with automatic monthly billing and volume discounts.

## How Usage-Based Pricing Works

**Simple concept:** You pay only for the credits you actually use each month. No upfront payments, no unused credits going to waste.

### **The Basics**

1. **Add a payment method** to your account
2. **Choose your tier** based on resolution needs and expected usage
3. **Use the API** - credits are consumed as you generate content
4. **Get billed monthly** based on your actual usage
5. **Automatic volume discounts** apply as you use more credits

### **Key Benefits**

✅ **No upfront costs** - Start using immediately without buying credits in advance  
✅ **Pay for actual usage** - Only pay for credits you actually consume  
✅ **Automatic billing** - Monthly invoices based on previous month's usage  
✅ **Volume discounts** - Up to 50% savings as you scale  
✅ **No waste** - Never lose unused credits

### **How It Differs from Subscriptions**

| Usage-Based                | Subscription               |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Pay after you use          | Pay upfront                |
| Automatic monthly billing  | Manual credit purchases    |
| Volume discounts included  | Fixed credit amounts       |
| No unused credits          | Credits can expire unused  |
| Perfect for variable usage | Good for predictable usage |

## Choose Your Tier

Each tier offers different resolution limits and credit pricing. Higher tiers unlock better resolution but cost more per credit.

## Volume Discounts (Automatic)

The more credits you use each month, the cheaper each credit becomes. Discounts apply automatically to different usage ranges within the same month.

**Example:** If you use 150,000 credits on Starter tier:

- First 100,000 credits: \$0.90 per 1000 credits
- Next 50,000 credits: \$0.81 per 1000 credits (10% discount)
- **Total cost:** \$90 + \$40.50 = \$130.50

### **Discount Tiers by Plan**

## Practical Examples

### **Small Developer (5,000 credits/month)**

- **Starter Tier**: 5,000 × \$0.0009 = **\$4.50/month**
- **Creator Tier**: 5,000 × \$0.0012 = **\$6.00/month**

_Choose Starter for basic resolution, Creator for higher quality_

### **Growing Business (75,000 credits/month)**

- **Starter Tier**: \$67.50/month (all at base rate)
- **Creator Tier**: \$90/month (all at base rate)
- **Pro Tier**: \$146.25/month (all at base rate)

_Volume discounts kick in at 100,000+ credits_

### **High Volume (500,000 credits/month)**

**Starter Tier with volume discounts:**

- First 100,000: \$90 (base rate)
- Next 400,000: \$324 (10% discount)
- **Total: \$414/month** (vs \$450 without discounts)

**Use our [cost calculator](https://magichour.ai/api#api-cost-calculator) for precise estimates with volume discounts included.**

## Getting Started

<Warning>
  **Currently requires setup assistance** - Usage-based pricing is not yet self-serve. We're working
  on making this automatic.
</Warning>

**To get started:**

1. **Contact our team** to set up usage-based billing:
   - Email: [support@magichour.ai](mailto:support@magichour.ai)
   - Use the Intercom chat widget on our website

2. **Choose your tier** based on resolution needs and expected usage

3. **Add payment method** - We'll help you set this up securely

4. **Start using the API** - Credits are tracked automatically

### **Billing Process**

- **Monthly billing** on the same date each month
- **High usage accounts** may be billed earlier (e.g., at \$500 threshold)
- **Detailed invoices** show credit usage breakdown by tier
- **Volume discounts** applied automatically

## Tracking usage

In the [Developer Hub](https://magichour.ai/developer), you can see your usage analytics for specific time ranges.

Also, you can view your upcoming invoice amount and total credit usage broken down by tier.
