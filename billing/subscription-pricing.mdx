## How Subscription Pricing Works

**Simple concept:** Pay upfront for a set amount of credits that you can use throughout your subscription period. Perfect for predictable usage patterns.

### **The Basics**

1. **Choose your plan** based on resolution needs and monthly credit requirements
2. **Select billing frequency** - monthly or yearly (yearly saves 33%)
3. **Pay upfront** and receive all credits immediately
4. **Use credits anytime** - credits never expire, even after subscription ends
5. **Auto-renewal** ensures continuous access (can be cancelled anytime)

### **Key Benefits**

✅ **Predictable costs** - Know exactly what you'll pay each month/year  
✅ **Credits upfront** - Get all your credits immediately to use anytime  
✅ **Yearly savings** - Get 33% off with annual billing  
✅ **No usage tracking** - Use credits at your own pace  
✅ **Higher resolution** - Access to better quality based on your tier

### **How It Differs from Usage-Based**

| Subscription                  | Usage-Based               |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Pay upfront                   | Pay after you use         |
| Fixed monthly cost            | Variable monthly cost     |
| Credits never expire          | Credits consumed as used  |
| Immediate credit access       | Pay only for what you use |
| Perfect for predictable usage | Good for variable usage   |

## Choose Your Plan

Each plan offers different credit amounts and resolution limits. Higher plans unlock better resolution and more credits per month.

## Need More Credits?

If you use more credits than your plan includes, you can purchase additional credit packs anytime.

### **Credit Packs**

- **1,000 credits per pack**
- **\$3.00 per pack** (\$0.003 per credit)
- **Instant delivery** - credits added immediately to your account
- **No expiration** - credits never expire, even after subscription ends

### **When to Buy Credit Packs**

- **Seasonal spikes** in usage
- **One-time projects** requiring extra credits
- **Testing higher usage** before upgrading plans
- **End-of-month** credit shortfall

<Note>
  **Tip:** If you consistently need credit packs, consider upgrading to the next plan tier for
  better value.
</Note>

## Practical Examples

### **Content Creator (5,000 credits/month)**

- **Free Plan**: 400 + (100 × 30 days) = 3,400 credits/month - **Not enough**
- **Creator Plan**: 10,000 credits/month from \$10/mo (billed annually) - **Perfect fit**

_Creator plan gives you 2x your needs with room to grow_

### **Marketing Agency (35,000 credits/month)**

- **Creator Plan**: 10,000 credits + 25 credit packs = \$10 + \$75 = **\$85/month**
- **Pro Plan**: 30,000 credits + 5 credit packs = \$30 + \$15 = **\$45/month** - **Better value**

_Pro plan saves \$40/month and provides buffer for growth_

### **Enterprise (200,000 credits/month)**

- **Pro Plan**: 30,000 + 170 credit packs = \$30 + \$510 = **\$540/month**
- **Business Plan**: 70,000 credits + 130 credit packs = \$66 + \$390 = **\$456/month** - **Much better value**

_Business plan saves \$84/month and includes 4K resolution_

### **Yearly vs Monthly Savings**

**Pro Plan Example:**

- **Monthly**: \$45 × 12 = **\$540/year**
- **Yearly**: **\$360/year** (33% off - equivalent to \$30/month)
