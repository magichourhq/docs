## Overview

Face Swap Photo lets you replace faces in static images with realistic precision and natural blending. The API swaps faces between two photos while preserving facial expressions, lighting conditions, and image quality for seamless results.

## How It Works

1. **Provide a source face** - Upload an image containing the face you want to use
2. **Provide a target image** - Upload the image where you want to swap the face
3. **API processes the swap** - AI detects faces, aligns features, and blends seamlessly
4. **Download the result** - Retrieve your face-swapped image

## Use Cases

- **Entertainment content** - Create fun social media content and memes
- **Privacy protection** - Replace faces to anonymize individuals in photos
- **Creative projects** - Character replacement in digital art and design
- **Marketing** - Personalized ad experiences with customer faces
- **Photo editing apps** - Build face swap features into your application

## Best Practices

### Image Quality

<Tip>
**Use high-resolution images** - Higher quality source images produce better results. Aim for at least 512x512 pixels for the face area.
</Tip>

- **Clear, well-lit faces** - Ensure faces are clearly visible with good lighting
- **Front-facing angles work best** - Extreme profile angles may reduce quality
- **Avoid obstructions** - Glasses, hands, or hair covering the face can affect results
- **Similar lighting conditions** - Match lighting between source and target for more natural results

### Face Detection Tips

- **One clear face per image** - The API works best with a single prominent face
- **Visible facial features** - Eyes, nose, and mouth should all be visible
- **Neutral to moderate expressions** - Extreme expressions may affect alignment

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|:------|:------|:---------|
| Face not detected | Face too small or obscured | Use a clearer, larger face image |
| Unnatural blending | Lighting mismatch | Match lighting between source and target |
| Distorted features | Extreme angle difference | Use more similar face angles |
| Low quality output | Low resolution input | Use higher resolution images |

## Code Examples

### Basic Face Swap

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from magic_hour import Client
import os

client = Client(token=os.getenv("MAGIC_HOUR_API_KEY"))

result = client.v1.face_swap_photo.generate(
    assets={
        "source_file_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/tomcruise.png",
        "target_file_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/lebron.jpg"
    },
    name="My Face Swap",
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="./outputs/"
)

print(f"✅ Face swap complete!")
print(f"Status: {result.status}")
print(f"Downloaded to: {result.downloaded_paths}")
print(f"Credits charged: {result.credits_charged}")
```

```javascript Node.js
import Client from 'magic-hour';

const client = new Client({ token: process.env.MAGIC_HOUR_API_KEY });

const result = await client.v1.faceSwapPhoto.generate({
  assets: {
    sourceFilePath: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/tomcruise.png",
    targetFilePath: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/tomcruise.png"
  },
  name: "My Face Swap",
  waitForCompletion: true,
  downloadOutputs: true,
  downloadDirectory: "./outputs/"
});

console.log(`✅ Face swap complete!`);
console.log(`Status: ${result.status}`);
console.log(`Downloaded to: ${result.downloadedPaths}`);
```

## Pricing

| Output | Credits |
|:-------|:--------|
| 1 face swap image | 5 credits |

<Info>
Credits are charged when the job is created. If the job fails, credits are refunded automatically.
