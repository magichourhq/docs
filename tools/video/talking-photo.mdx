## Overview

AI Talking Photo brings static photos to life by animating faces to speak with realistic lip-sync and natural facial movements. The API analyzes facial features and synchronizes mouth movements, head poses, and expressions with provided audio or generated speech.

  type="video"
  outputs={[
    {
      src: "/get-started/images/talkingphotoexample1.mp4",
    },
    {
      src: "/get-started/images/talkingphotoexample2.mp4",
    },
  ]}
/>

## How It Works

1. **Provide a photo** - Upload an image with a clear face
2. **Add audio** - Upload audio or provide text for speech generation
3. **API animates** - AI creates realistic lip-sync and facial movements
4. **Download video** - Retrieve your animated talking photo

## Use Cases

- **Marketing videos** - Create spokesperson videos from headshots
- **Educational content** - Animate historical figures or characters
- **Personalized messages** - Send video messages from static photos
- **Social media** - Create engaging content from profile pictures
- **Presentations** - Add dynamic talking heads to slides

## Best Practices

### Photo Selection

<Tip>
  **Use clear, front-facing photos** - Best results come from high-quality headshots with visible
  facial features.
</Tip>

- **Good lighting** - Well-lit faces produce better animations
- **Front-facing angles** - Avoid extreme profile shots
- **Clear features** - Eyes, nose, and mouth should be unobstructed
- **High resolution** - At least 512x512 pixels recommended

### Audio Guidelines

| Audio Type       | Best Practice                          |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Voice recording  | Clear speech without background noise  |
| Generated speech | Use natural-sounding text prompts      |
| Music/songs      | Works best with clear vocals           |
| Length           | Keep under 30 seconds for best results |

## Code Examples

### Basic Talking Photo with Text

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from magic_hour import Client
from os import getenv

client = Client(token=getenv("API_TOKEN"))

result = client.v1.ai_talking_photo.generate(
    assets={
        "image_file_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/tomcruise.png",
        "audio_file_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/you-are-just-a-line-of-code.mp3"
    },
    name="Talking Photo",
    start_seconds=0,
    end_seconds=2,
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="outputs"
)

if result.status == "complete":
    print(f"✅ Talking photo complete!")
    print(f"Downloaded to: {result.downloaded_paths}")
    print(f"Credits charged: {result.credits_charged}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Job failed with status: {result.status}")
    if hasattr(result, 'error_message'):
        print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")
```

```javascript Node.js
import { Client } from "magic-hour";

const client = new Client({ token: process.env.API_TOKEN });

const result = await client.v1.aiTalkingPhoto.generate({
  assets: {
    imageFilePath: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/tomcruise.png",
    audioFilePath:
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/you-are-just-a-line-of-code.mp3",
  },
  name: "Talking Photo",
  startSeconds: 0,
  endSeconds: 2,
  waitForCompletion: true,
  downloadOutputs: true,
  downloadDirectory: "outputs",
});

console.log(`✅ Talking photo complete!`);
console.log(`Status: ${result.status}`);
console.log(`Downloaded to: ${result.downloadedPaths}`);
```

</CodeGroup>

### With Audio File

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
result = client.v1.ai_talking_photo.generate(
    assets={
        "image_file_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/tomcruise.png",
        "audio_file_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/you-are-just-a-line-of-code.mp3"
    },
    name="Talking Photo",
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="outputs"
)

if result.status == "complete":
    print(f"✅ Talking photo complete!")
    print(f"Downloaded to: {result.downloaded_paths}")
    print(f"Credits charged: {result.credits_charged}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Job failed with status: {result.status}")
    if hasattr(result, 'error_message'):
        print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")
```

```javascript Node.js
const result = await client.v1.aiTalkingPhoto.generate({
  assets: {
    imageFilePath: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/tomcruise.png",
    audioFilePath:
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/you-are-just-a-line-of-code.mp3",
  },
  name: "Talking Photo",
  waitForCompletion: true,
  downloadOutputs: true,
  downloadDirectory: "outputs",
});

console.log(`✅ Talking photo complete!`);
console.log(`Status: ${result.status}`);
console.log(`Downloaded to: ${result.downloadedPaths}`);
```
