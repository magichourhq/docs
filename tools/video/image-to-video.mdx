## Overview

Image to Video converts static images into dynamic video content with AI-generated motion and cinematic effects. The API analyzes images and creates realistic movement, camera motion, and environmental effects to bring still photos to life.

## How It Works

1. **Provide a source image** - Upload the image you want to animate
2. **Describe the motion** - Use a text prompt to describe how it should move
3. **API generates the video** - AI creates natural motion and effects
4. **Download the result** - Retrieve your animated video

## Use Cases

- **Social media content** - Turn photos into engaging video posts
- **Marketing videos** - Create dynamic content from product photos
- **Storytelling** - Bring static images to life for narratives
- **Real estate** - Animate property photos for virtual tours
- **E-commerce** - Dynamic product showcases

## Best Practices

### Source Image Quality

<Tip>
**Use high-quality images with clear subjects** - Better images produce smoother, more realistic animations.
</Tip>

- **High resolution** - At least 720p for best results
- **Clear subjects** - Well-defined elements animate better
- **Good composition** - Leave "room" for motion in your frame
- **Appropriate content** - Images with implied motion work well

### Motion Prompts

Describe the motion you want to see:

**✅ Good prompts:**
- "Camera slowly panning right, leaves gently swaying in wind"
- "Zoom in on the subject with slight parallax effect"
- "Water rippling, clouds moving slowly across the sky"
- "Person walking forward, hair blowing in breeze"

**❌ Avoid:**
- No motion description: "A beautiful landscape"
- Impossible physics: "Person flying through wall"
- Conflicting motions: "Zoom in and zoom out simultaneously"

### Image Types That Animate Well

| Image Type | Animation Potential | Tips |
|:-----------|:-------------------|:-----|
| Landscapes | Excellent | Add wind, water, cloud motion |
| Portraits | Good | Subtle movements, blinks, breathing |
| Product photos | Moderate | Camera motion, lighting effects |
| Abstract art | Excellent | Morphing, flowing effects |

## Code Examples

### Basic Image to Video

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from magic_hour import Client
import os

client = Client(token=os.getenv("MAGIC_HOUR_API_KEY"))

result = client.v1.image_to_video.generate(
    assets={
        "image_file_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/sunset.jpg"
    },
    style={
        "prompt":  "Sunset landscape with subtle parallax effect while panning, clouds moving cinematic depth"
    },
    end_seconds=5,
    name="Sunset Animation",
    resolution="480p",
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="./outputs/"
)

if result.status == "complete":
    print(f"✅ Video complete!")
    print(f"Downloaded to: {result.downloaded_paths}")
    print(f"Credits charged: {result.credits_charged}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Job failed with status: {result.status}")
    if hasattr(result, 'error_message'):
        print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")
```

```javascript Node.js
import Client from 'magic-hour';

const client = new Client({ token: process.env.MAGIC_HOUR_API_KEY });

const result = await client.v1.imageToVideo.generate({
  assets: {
    imageFilePath: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/sunset.jpg"
  },
  style: {
    prompt: "Sunset landscape with subtle camera movement, gentle parallax effect, cinematic depth"
  },
  endSeconds: 1.5,
  name: "Sunset Animation",
  resolution: "480p",
  waitForCompletion: true,
  downloadOutputs: true,
  downloadDirectory: "./outputs/"
});

console.log(`✅ Video complete!`);
console.log(`Status: ${result.status}`);
console.log(`Downloaded to: ${result.downloadedPaths}`);
```

## Pricing

Image to Video uses credits based on video duration:

{/* TODO: Verify exact credit calculation */}

| Duration | Approximate Credits |
|:---------|:--------------------|
| 5 seconds | ~150 credits |
| 10 seconds | ~300 credits |

Higher resolutions cost more per second.

## Resolution Limits

Image to Video has a maximum resolution of **1080p** (1920x1080 or 1080x1920).
