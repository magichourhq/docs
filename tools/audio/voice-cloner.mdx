import { ToolSection } from "/snippets/tool-section.mdx";

## Overview

AI Voice Cloner creates realistic speech audio from text by cloning voices from sample audio files. The API analyzes the unique characteristics of a voice sample and produces high-quality voice synthesis with natural intonation, emotion, and speaking patterns that closely match the original voice.

## How It Works

1. **Upload voice sample** - Provide an audio file of the voice you want to clone
2. **Write the text** - Enter the text you want spoken in the cloned voice
3. **API clones and generates** - AI analyzes the voice and synthesizes speech
4. **Download the result** - Retrieve your audio file with the cloned voice

## Use Cases

- **Content creation** - Clone your own voice for consistent narration
- **Voice preservation** - Preserve voices of loved ones or historical figures
- **Multilingual content** - Create content in your voice across languages
- **Personalized assistants** - Custom voice for virtual assistants and chatbots
- **Accessibility** - Text-to-speech with your own voice
- **Entertainment** - Create audio content with specific voice characteristics

## Voice Sample Requirements

For best results, your voice sample should:

- **Be clear and high-quality** - Minimal background noise
- **Be 10-30 seconds long** - Enough audio for the AI to learn the voice
- **Contain natural speech** - Conversational tone works best
- **Be single-speaker** - Only one person speaking in the sample
- **Have good enunciation** - Clear pronunciation of words

<Tip>
  **Quality tip** - Use a quiet environment and a good microphone for recording your voice sample.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Voice Sample Guidelines

<Tip>
  **Record naturally** - Speak in your natural tone and pace for the most authentic cloning.
</Tip>

- **Natural speech** - Read naturally, not robotically
- **Good audio quality** - Use proper recording equipment
- **Consistent volume** - Maintain steady speaking volume
- **No background noise** - Record in a quiet environment
- **Varied intonation** - Include different emotions and tones

### Text Guidelines

- **Natural punctuation** - Use periods, commas, and question marks for natural pauses
- **Avoid abbreviations** - Write out words fully (e.g., "Mister" not "Mr.")
- **Short sentences** - Break long text into shorter, digestible sentences
- **Read it aloud** - Test how text sounds before generating

### Optimizing Output Quality

| Technique           | Why It Helps                              |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| High-quality sample | Better voice characteristics captured     |
| Natural punctuation | Creates appropriate pauses and intonation |
| Phonetic spelling   | Helps with unusual words or names         |
| Sentence breaks     | Improves rhythm and comprehension         |

### Text Length Considerations

- **Short clips** - 1-2 sentences work great for social media
- **Medium content** - Paragraphs work well for narration
- **Long content** - Consider breaking into multiple clips for variety

## Code Examples

### Basic Voice Cloning

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from magic_hour import Client
from os import getenv

client = Client(token=getenv("API_TOKEN"))

result = client.v1.ai_voice_cloner.generate(
    assets={
        "audio_file_path": "path/to/voice_sample.mp3"
    },
    style={
        "prompt": "Hello! This is a test of the Magic Hour voice cloner. Pretty cool, right?"
    },
    name="Voice Cloner audio",
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="outputs"
)

if result.status == "complete":
    print(f"✅ Voice cloning complete!")
    print(f"Downloaded to: {result.downloaded_paths}")
    print(f"Credits charged: {result.credits_charged}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Job failed with status: {result.status}")
    if hasattr(result, 'error_message'):
        print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")

```

```javascript Node.js
import Client from "magic-hour";

const client = new Client({ token: process.env.API_TOKEN });

const result = await client.v1.aiVoiceCloner.generate({
  assets: {
    audioFilePath: "path/to/voice_sample.mp3",
  },
  style: {
    prompt: "Hello! This is a test of the Magic Hour voice cloner. Pretty cool, right?",
  },
  name: "Voice Cloner audio",
  waitForCompletion: true,
  downloadOutputs: true,
  downloadDirectory: "outputs",
});

console.log(`✅ Voice cloning complete!`);
console.log(`Status: ${result.status}`);
console.log(`Downloaded to: ${result.downloadedPaths}`);
```

### Clone Voice with URL

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
result = client.v1.ai_voice_cloner.generate(
    assets={
        "audio_file_path": "https://example.com/voice_sample.mp3"
    },
    style={
        "prompt": "Welcome to the show! Today we're going to talk about something really exciting."
    },
    name: "Voice Cloner audio",
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="outputs"
)

if result.status == "complete":
    print(f"✅ Voice cloning complete!")
    print(f"Downloaded to: {result.downloaded_paths}")
    print(f"Credits charged: {result.credits_charged}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Job failed with status: {result.status}")
    if hasattr(result, 'error_message'):
        print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")
```

```javascript Node.js
const result = await client.v1.aiVoiceCloner.generate({
  assets: {
    audioFilePath: "https://example.com/voice_sample.mp3",
  },
  style: {
    prompt: "Welcome to the show! Today we're going to talk about something really exciting.",
  },
  name: "Voice Cloner audio",
  waitForCompletion: true,
  downloadOutputs: true,
  downloadDirectory: "outputs",
});

console.log(`✅ Downloaded to: ${result.downloadedPaths}`);
```

### Combining with Lip Sync

Clone a voice, then sync it to a video:

```python Python
from magic_hour import Client
from os import getenv

client = Client(token=getenv("API_TOKEN"))

# Step 1: Clone the voice
from pathlib import Path

# Make sure download dirs exist
Path("temp").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
Path("outputs").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Step 1: Clone the voice
voice_result = client.v1.ai_voice_cloner.generate(
    assets={
        "audio_file_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/you-are-just-a-line-of-code.mp3"
    },
    style={
        "prompt": "This is my custom voiceover for the video."
    },
    name="Voice Cloner audio",
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="temp",
)

# Step 2: Use the generated audio for lip sync
lip_sync_result = client.v1.lip_sync.generate(
    assets={
        "video_file_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runshouse/Sample_Assets/main/sideeyegirl.mp4",
        "audio_file_path": voice_result.downloaded_paths[0],  # local path now exists
        "video_source": "file",  # see note below
    },
    start_seconds=0,
    end_seconds=2,
    max_fps_limit=30,
    style={"generation_mode": "lite"},
    name="Lip Synced Video",
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="outputs",
)

print("voice_status:", voice_result.status, "paths:", getattr(voice_result, "downloaded_paths", None))
print("lip_status:", lip_sync_result.status, "paths:", getattr(lip_sync_result, "downloaded_paths", None))

```

## Pricing

{/* TODO: Verify exact credit calculation */}

Voice cloning uses credits based on text length and processing:

| Text Length                | Approximate Credits |
| :------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Short (1-2 sentences)      | ~10 credits         |
| Medium (paragraph)         | ~20-30 credits      |
| Long (multiple paragraphs) | ~50+ credits        |
